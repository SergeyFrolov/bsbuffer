## <a name="BSBuffer">type</a> [BSBuffer](bsbuffer.go?s=360:591#L7)
``` go
type BSBuffer struct {
    sync.Mutex
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```
BSBuffer:
B - Blocking - Read() calls are blocking.
S - Safe - Supports arbitrary amount of readers and writers.
Could be unblocked and turned into SBuffer.







### <a name="NewBSBuffer">func</a> [NewBSBuffer](bsbuffer.go?s=617:645#L22)
``` go
func NewBSBuffer() *BSBuffer
```
Creates new BSBuffer





### <a name="BSBuffer.Read">func</a> (\*BSBuffer) [Read](bsbuffer.go?s=1321:1373#L53)
``` go
func (b *BSBuffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```
Reads data from the BSBuffer, blocking until a writer arrives or the BSBuffer is unblocked.
If the write end is closed with an error, that error is returned as err; otherwise err is EOF.
Supports multiple concurrent goroutines and p is valid forever.




### <a name="BSBuffer.Unblock">func</a> (\*BSBuffer) [Unblock](bsbuffer.go?s=2501:2529#L98)
``` go
func (b *BSBuffer) Unblock()
```
Turns BSBuffer into SBuffer: Read() is no longer blocking, but still safe.
Unblock() is safe to call multiple times.




### <a name="BSBuffer.Write">func</a> (\*BSBuffer) [Write](bsbuffer.go?s=1988:2041#L75)
``` go
func (b *BSBuffer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```
Non-blocking write appends the contents of p to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed.
The return value n is the length of p; err is always nil.
If the buffer becomes too large, Write will panic with ErrTooLarge.
Supports multiple concurrent goroutines and p is safe for reuse right away.
